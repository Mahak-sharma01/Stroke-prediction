# Understanding Stroke Risk with Healthcare Data

__What is this project about?__

This project uses a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) containing information about patients, like their age, gender, lifestyle, and health metrics, to understand the risk factors associated with stroke. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on these factors.

__Why is it important?__

Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have life-altering consequences. By identifying the factors that contribute to stroke risk, we can potentially prevent strokes and improve patient outcomes.

__What does the dataset contain?__

The dataset includes information about:

Patient demographics (age, gender)
Health metrics (hypertension, heart disease, BMI)
Lifestyle factors (smoking status, work type)
Other details (marital status, residence type, average glucose level)

__How can the data be used?__

Predicting Stroke Risk: Using machine learning models, we can predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke based on their characteristics.
Understanding Impact of Age: We can analyze how age affects the risk of stroke, which can help in identifying high-risk groups.
Exploring BMI Relationship: By studying the relationship between BMI and stroke, we can gain insights into the importance of maintaining a healthy weight.

__How to use this project?__

Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to understand its contents and distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and convert categorical variables into a format suitable for analysis.
Model Building: Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN) to predict stroke risk.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models to determine their effectiveness in predicting stroke risk.

Understanding Stroke Risk with Healthcare Data

What is this project about?
This project uses a dataset containing information about patients, like their age, gender, lifestyle, and health metrics, to understand the risk factors associated with stroke. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have a stroke based on these factors.

Why is it important?
Stroke is a serious medical condition that can have life-altering consequences. By identifying the factors that contribute to stroke risk, we can potentially prevent strokes and improve patient outcomes.

What does the dataset contain?
The dataset includes information about:

Patient demographics (age, gender)
Health metrics (hypertension, heart disease, BMI)
Lifestyle factors (smoking status, work type)
Other details (marital status, residence type, average glucose level)

How can the data be used?
Predicting Stroke Risk: Using machine learning models, we can predict the likelihood of a patient having a stroke based on their characteristics.
Understanding Impact of Age: We can analyze how age affects the risk of stroke, which can help in identifying high-risk groups.
Exploring BMI Relationship: By studying the relationship between BMI and stroke, we can gain insights into the importance of maintaining a healthy weight.

How to use this project?
Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to understand its contents and distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and convert categorical variables into a format suitable for analysis.
Model Building: Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN) to predict stroke risk.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models to determine their effectiveness in predicting stroke risk.
